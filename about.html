            <p class="about__desc">Today, Street77 is one of the leading fast food establishments. We started our activity on August 28, 2015. The first branch was opened in the shopping center NEXT. At the initial stage of development, the menu could not boast of great abundance, but the variety of all kinds of sandwiches, which at that time were the basis of the menu, quickly managed to win the love of guests. Satisfied with the result, but not intending to stop there, we continued to improve. Just a couple of months later, on October 25, 2015, a new branch was opened in the Samarqand Darvoza shopping mall. And only after a little more than a year and a half, on May 14, 2017, our main branch was opened at C1, a cozy place where you can have a good time with family, friends and your loved one. Colossal changes were made to the menu, a lot was removed, something was changed, and even more was added, but the quality and taste, so highly appreciated by our dear visitors, remained unchanged. Trying to please our guests, we are expanding delivery areas, updating the menu, in line with world-class brands. Each ingredient used in our kitchen is carefully controlled to become a delicious dish and decoration of your table! Today, Street77 is ready to please you and your loved ones with delicious burgers with minced beef cutlets, pollock fillet, crispy breaded chicken, delicious salads, soups, and more recently pizza! And we do not intend to stop there. Thank you for staying with us day after day, year after year, let's create our own menu, the wishes of our guests are the basis of our innovations, and someday Street77 will delight you with our favorite dishes on every street in Tashkent!
